# Cultivate
Cultivate is a text-based arcade game reminiscent of something I created in high school.
The objective of this game is to keep your garden going as long as possible in order to maximize score. 

## Getting Started
You can play Cultivate with the help of Python3.

*Prerequisites*
* Install Python3

*Running*
* Clone or download to your desired location
* Launch main.py 
  * Use your Python launcher
  * or in unix: `Python3 main.py`
  
## Game Rules
* TBD (or rather, written)
